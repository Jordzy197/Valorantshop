    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p class="updates">Hello, all! Jo-Ellen here.<br><br><br>

You‚Äôll notice a few new things in this patch: the Spray Wheel, a different looking Spray display on your Collections page, and a few updated Agent<br> portraits. Many of these features we‚Äôre excited for ourselves. We‚Äôve also fixed a number of Yoru bugs whether for when you‚Äôre playing against or<br> as him. Lastly, get into a game and listen for some new Reyna voiceover lines.<br>

As always, let us know what you think about all the newest things coming to Patch 6.10. Enjoy!</p><br>

<center><p>GENERAL UPDATES<br>
Spray Wheel, Collections Rework, Spray Equip Flow Improvements<br>

We have been cooking up some new features to allow you greater flexibility when using and collecting Sprays and we are happy to launch our first<br> iteration of these improvements with this pass. Introducing the Spray Wheel!<br>

Added an in-game Spray Wheel, which can be activated by holding your chosen Spray Keybind.<br>
Retained Quick Spray functionality by tapping your chosen Spray Keybind. This will use the Spray located at the top slot of your wheel.<br>
Added new equip flow for the Spray Wheel located in the Collections page.<br>
Replaced the Spray Carousel with a Grid that can be searched, filtered, and sorted by Favorites.<br>
Added an audio queue and visible timer to indicate cooldowns on the Spray Wheel.<br>
Added an ‚ÄúEmpty Spray‚Äù to allow a user to empty their Wheel or keybind.<br>
Added a text and image to indicate pre- or post-round only sprays.<br>
Added settings to the Settings page under Controls -> Equipment to better customize your spraying experience<br>
This includes a sensitivity slider, the ability to turn off the wheel entirely, and separate the keybinds.<br>
Removed the ‚Äúwall‚Äù texture to display Sprays on the Spray Screen.<br>
We hope you‚Äôre as excited about this as we are! We acknowledge this is a large change and will take some getting used to. As such, we‚Äôll be<br> listening closely to user feedback as you get used to the new system and making improvements and adjustments in the future.<br></p><br><br>

<p>MISC.<br>
We‚Äôve updated Fade‚Äôs in-game portrait for better gameplay readability and quality consistency.<br>
We‚Äôve updated Harbor‚Äôs in-game portrait for better gameplay readability and quality consistency.<br>
We‚Äôve updated some Agent portraits to be higher resolution.<br>
Improved the hitbox on KAY/O‚Äôs ZERO/Point (E) so shooting the handle of the knife destroys it.<br>
We regularly review Agent voiceovers to deepen, improve, and refresh their in-game dialogue. We‚Äôve added new lines for Reyna to develop her<br> relationships with new and existing Agents<br>
Added new Reyna Voiceover Lines and interaction lines with Gekko, Chamber, and KAY/O.<br>
COSMETICS UPDATES<br>
The RGX 11z Pro EP 4 Gun Buddy and Oni EP 6 Gun Buddy now have the variant shift feature on their corresponding older bundles. You can now put your<br>RGX EP 4 Gun Buddy on your Vandal and it shifts its color just like it does in the Phantom‚Äîno more mix and match!<br>
GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS UPDATES<br>
We've updated our fonts to fix missing character glyphs that occur in some languages.<br><br><br>
BUG FIXES<br><br>
AGENTS<br>
Fixed an issue where Yoru‚Äôs Fakeout (C) would min flash you if you were outside of its conal range of effect.<br>
Fixed issue that was causing a slight delay between sources of concussion hitting you and the actual effects of the debuff being applied.<br>
Fixed a bug where Yoru‚Äôs Fakeout (C) echo would sometimes not have a weapon equipped.<br>
The weapon that Yoru‚Äôs Fakeout (C) echo equips should now use a more accurate weapons skin.<br>
Killjoy spent some time in the workshop hammering out bugs that were causing her Turret (E) to aim at the ground. (Fixed in Patch 6.09)<br>
GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS UPDATES<br>
Fixed a rare issue where you can see ghost enemies when they‚Äôve entered line of sight.<br>
Fixed an issue where under certain conditions, you can continue to defuse the Spike out of line of sight.<br><br><br>
KNOWN ISSUES<br>
Spray Wheel<br>

The Spray Wheel can be called in the Range, however, you can‚Äôt spray in the Range. We‚Äôve never been able to spray in the Range, so this isn‚Äôt a<br> change, but the wheel is sending mixed signals. We‚Äôll fix this in a future patch.<br>
In Arabic, there‚Äôs a slight overlap between the Spray Title and ‚ÄúPre/Post Round‚Äù Informational text on the Spray Screen.<br>
Zooming in on Sprays in the Collections tab puts the Spray over the Title text instead of behind it like it was in the previous Collections page.<br>
Spray Wheel instructional text in the Collections tab doesn‚Äôt indicate your current keybinds. We‚Äôll fix this in a future iteration.<br></p></center>
